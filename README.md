# @hacdias' dotfiles and scripts

This repository contains my dotfiles and scripts. Easy to synchronize and setup on a new machine for the first time. A little reminder to myself: please take a look at the scripts before running them and check if I want all packages that are installed.

Quick setup:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hacdias/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

Most likely some error might've just occurred. I will try to fix it.
